  clipperInfoLines1:
  - Some corals are struggling because of pollution and heat. Harmful fungi have
    started growing nearby, making it hard for new coral to survive.
  - " If we don\u2019t clear them out, these fungi can spread and affect healthy
    coral too. Let\u2019s take care of it before that happens."
  clipperInfoLines2:
  - " Use the Coral Clippers to remove the infected areas around the coral. You're
    not cutting the coral itself\u2014just cleaning the harmful fungi."
  - We'll safely collect and dispose of what you clean. Focus on removing anything
    that looks soft, dark, or out of place.

  - "The coral looks pale like a ghost! When ocean water gets too hot, coral gets
    stressed and kicks out the tiny helpful algae that give them food and color.
    That\u2019s called bleaching."
  - "Broken coral pieces are like little plant cuttings\u2014they can grow again
    if we give them a good home! This helps rebuild the reef and bring fishy friends
    back!"
  glueInfoLines2:
  - "Pick a clean, sunny spot on the rock. Use the coral glue (it\u2019s ocean-safe!)
    to stick the baby coral piece down."
