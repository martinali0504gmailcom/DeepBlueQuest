  - Oh no! Some corals got sick from dirty water and too much heat. Sneaky fungi
    and germs are hurting them!
  - "If we don\u2019t help, the sickness could spread to their coral neighbors!"
  clipperInfoLines2:
  - Use the Coral Clippers to snip away the sick, mushy parts of the coral.
  - We'll take the pieces somewhere else to glue, just grab it for now!

  - "The coral looks pale like a ghost! When ocean water gets too hot, coral gets
    stressed and kicks out the tiny helpful algae that give them food and color.
    That\u2019s called bleaching."
  - "Broken coral pieces are like little plant cuttings\u2014they can grow again
    if we give them a good home! This helps rebuild the reef and bring fishy friends
    back!"
  glueInfoLines2:
  - "Pick a clean, sunny spot on the rock. Use the coral glue (it\u2019s ocean-safe!)
    to stick the baby coral piece down."
