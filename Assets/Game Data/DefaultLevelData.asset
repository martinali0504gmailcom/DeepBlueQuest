  initialText: Look around and snip pieces of dead coral, then glue them to rocks!
    Do this three times! Move with WASD or the Arrow Keys! Look with the mouse! Use
    Space/Right Ctrl to go up and Shift to go down! Use Q or / to interact with the
    objectives! Open your inventory of tools with E! You have enough oxygen to stay
    underwater for 45 minutes! Good Luck!

    Sneaky fungi and germs are hurting them! If we don\u2019t help, the sickness
    could spread to their coral neighbors!"
  clipperInfoText2: "Use the Coral Clippers to snip away the sick, mushy parts of
    the coral. Be gentle\u2014only cut what looks fuzzy or brown. Toss the  pieces
    in the special bin!"

  vaccumInfoText1: "Trash and dirty stuff from land floated into the ocean. Chemicals,
    plastic, and oil can hurt coral, make fish sick, and turn our beautiful reef
    into a mess. Coral need clean water to grow\u2014just like flowers need clean
    soil!"

    out for baby fish\u2014don\u2019t slurp them up by mistake!"

  glueInfoText1: " The coral looks pale like a ghost! When ocean water gets too hot,
    coral gets stressed and kicks out the tiny helpful algae that give them food
    and color. That\u2019s called bleaching. Without their algae buddies, coral get
    hungry and weak... and might not survive.\n\nBroken coral pieces are like little
    plant cuttings\u2014they can grow again if we give them a good home! This helps
    rebuild the reef and bring fishy friends back!"
  glueInfoText2: "Pick a clean, sunny spot on the rock. Use the coral glue (it\u2019s
    ocean-safe!) to stick the baby coral piece down. Hold it for 3...2...1...done!"

    you.
